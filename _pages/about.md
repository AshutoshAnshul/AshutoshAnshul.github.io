I am Ashutosh Anshul, PhD student in College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS) at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am currently working in the field of Computer Vision and Speech Processing under the guidance of [Prof Deepu Rajan](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ASDRajan/) and [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://aseschng.github.io/intro1.html). My research problem focuses on detecting and localizing Multimodal Deepfakes.
